# >> Features
* ✅ Card-Based Discovery: A clean, visually appealing UI to browse available skills.
* ✅ User Authentication: Secure registration and login for students and mentors.
* ✅ Skill Management: Users can post their own skills and manage their listings.
* ✅ Request System: A dedicated system to send and track skill exchange requests between users.
* ✅ Search Functionality: Real-time search to find specific expertise instantly.
* ✅ Admin Control Panel: Specialized dashboard to manage users and moderate posts for platform safety.

# >> Tech Stack
# Frontend:
Developed using HTML5 and CSS3 with a custom card-based design. The focus was on creating a responsive and intuitive user interface that makes browsing skills as easy as scrolling through a social feed.

# Backend:
Built with PHP, handling session management, user authentication, and the logic for the skill request system. It follows a modular structure where administrative tasks are isolated in a secure directory.

# Database:
Powered by MySQL. The database is designed with normalized tables including users, skills, and requests. It utilizes relational mapping to connect "Senders" and "Receivers" in the exchange process.
